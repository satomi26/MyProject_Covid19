# COVID-19 Analysis

## 1. Introduction

For my final project at my ourse, I chose to analyze data on the global Covid-19 pandemic.
My aim was to observe the overall trend of the pandemic as well as the number of cases and deaths across different countries in the last three years. I was also interested in identifying the key factors that contribute to the number of infections and deaths. So I tried to figure out key factors. 

## 2. About the dataset

The data I used for this project comes from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), a scientific online publication that focuses on major global issues such as poverty, disease, hunger, and climate change. Their Covid-19 dataset is updated daily throughout the pandemic, and I downloaded the dataset at the beginning of April. Therefore, the dataset covers the period from January 2020 to March 2023.

The dataset contains a wealth of information on Covid-19 from around the world, with more than 300,000 rows and 66 columns, covering over 200 countries. To make the data more manageable for analysis, I cleaned the dataset and reduced the number of columns to those that were relevant for my analysis. Additionally, I performed feature engineering to create new columns based on existing column values.

## 3. Data Cleaning

- removed some columns, that I don't use for my analysis
- removed Continent name from location. (for example, Afrika, Asia, North America, upper income usw.) In the location column I wanted to have only country


## 4. Data Visualisierung
For the data visualization, I used both Python and Tableau. The link for Tableau dashboard is: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/satomi4863/viz/WorldCovid-19Tracker2/Dashboard23
